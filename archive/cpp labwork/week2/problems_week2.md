Enter a decimal number: 13

Binary representation: 1101

### 8. Implement a C++ program to calculate Investment Growth with Compound Interest:You want to invest a certain amount ('a') in a long-term account with a fixed interest rate ('r'). Write a program to calculate the investment's value over 'n'years and print the growth at each interval. This will help you plan your financial future wisely.

**Sample Test Case**

Enter the starting investment (a): 5000

Enter the common ratio (r): 1.1

Enter the number of years (n): 5

Investment Growth Over Time (GP with common ratio 1.1):

Year 1: $5000

Year 2: $5500

Year 3: $6050

Year 4: $6655

Year 5: $7320.5

### 9. Implement a C++ program to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two given positive integers 'a' and 'b' using the Euclidean algorithm with a loop.

**Sample Test Case**

Enter two positive integers 'a' and 'b': 24 18

GCD of 24 and 18 is: 6

### 10. Create a C++ program for a personal health tracker. Input weight and height to calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI).

**Sample Test Case**

Enter your weight in kilograms: 70

Enter your height in meters: 1.645

You are overweight!
