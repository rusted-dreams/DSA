/*
Approach:
1. Maintain a stack (`st`) to keep track of indices of previous prices.
2. Use an array (`prices`) to store all the stock prices.
3. For each new price:
   - Pop elements from the stack while the top elementâ€™s price is **less than or equal** to the current price.
   - Compute the span as the difference between the current day and the top element of the stack.
   - If the stack is empty, the span is `day + 1` (meaning all previous days had lower prices).
   - Push the current day index onto the stack.
4. This ensures that for each price, we efficiently find the number of consecutive days with a lower or equal price.
